##Â Status
Initial version without any really important stuff like testing, tslint, uglify, database example. They will follow...
Also, not much CSS stuff, I will someday take a look of LESS and use it in somewhere


## Project Structure
This repository contains necessary files for fetching backend, frontend and typedefinitions from their own sub-repositories.

Might feel little bit overkill for now, but if and when the simple components starts to grow and starts to live their own life...

## How to get started
-- install nodejs, bower
1. *$ git clone https://github.com/arikekalainen/bas-web-ser.git*
2. *$ cd bas-web-ser*
3. *$ git submodule update --init*
4. *$ cd bas-web-ser-example-app*
5. *$ npm install*
6. *$ gulp*
7. *$ cd release*
8. *$ nodejs backend/main.js*
9. *Open web browser and surf to http://localhost:3000*

Enjoy! I will.
